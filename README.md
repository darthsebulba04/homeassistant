# Home Assistant Configuration

The goal of this setup is to create a home automation system that has no cloud dependancy.  After losing almost all cloud controlled based services over the last year, I decided to DIY all of it and never deal with that again.  There are no hubs or outside controllers in this.  Everything is controlled with a standard install of [Home Assistant] on a Raspberry Pi.

Everything but the [Nest] thermostat is controlled locally and has no online requirement.

Subscribed to [Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa] for location tracking and easy remote access.

If this kind of setup interests you, I wrote up a basic [install] doc for how I accomplished this.
